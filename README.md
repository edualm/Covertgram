# Covertgram

covert (kʌvət) - not openly acknowledged or displayed.

Originally, this app was going to be published on the App Store, but Apple didn't like it. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Here's the description I had written:

> Covertgram is an alternative app for Instagram that allows you to have a separate Instagram feed and anonymously and privately follow public profiles. You do not even need to have an account on Instagram to use this app (or an account in any service, whatsoever).
> 
> Use this app for those profiles you don't want your friends or acquaintances to know that you are following, or just to keep a clear separation between people you are following.
> 
> You can save the posts you want to see even when you don't have an internet connection - be them posts with a single image, many images or even a video... with full metadata!
> 
> Additionally, if you have an Apple Watch, you can be even more covert and check out your feed from your watch!

## Compatibility

This app runs on iOS + watchOS and macOS.

A Developer ID-signed macOS build is provided in the releases section of this repository.

As for the iOS one, you can just clone the repo and build it.

This app is used by me and friends, so expect some updates from time to time. Nothing major though!
